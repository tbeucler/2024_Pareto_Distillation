# Distilling Machine Learning's Added Value: Pareto Fronts in Atmospheric Applications

Welcome to the repository accompanying the manuscript "Distilling Machine Learning's Added Value: Pareto Fronts in Atmospheric Applications". This repository provides the reduced data and notebook to reproduce the Pareto-optimal model hierarchy for three atmospheric physics applications:

1. **Data-driven Equation Discovery of a Cloud Cover Parameterization**  
   Building upon [Grundner et al., 2024](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023MS003763)
   
2. **Emulation of Shortwave Radiative Transfer**  
   Building upon [Lagerquist et al., 2023](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atot/40/11/JTECH-D-23-0012.1.xml)
   
3. **Modeling of Tropical Precipitation**  
   Building upon [Shamekh et al., 2023](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2216158120)

## Getting Started

To get started, you can run the main notebook directly on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tbeucler/2024_UNIL_Geoinformatique/blob/main/Colab_Notebook.ipynb). This notebook will guide you through the process of reproducing our results.

## Repository Structure

- **[Reduced_Data/](https://github.com/tbeucler/2024_Pareto_Distillation/tree/main/Reduced_Data)**: Contains the reduced data sets used in our analysis.
- **[Figures/](https://github.com/tbeucler/2024_Pareto_Distillation/tree/main/Figures)**: Houses all figures in PDF format for easy access and review.
